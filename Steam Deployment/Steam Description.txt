Display real time duration of one game day and display frames per second (FPS)

[h1]Detailed Description[/h1]
This mod displays two key measurements related to the performance of Cities:Skylines on your computer:
1.  Real time duration of a game day, which indicates CPU performance.
2.  Frames per second (FPS), which indicates GPU performance.

The real time in seconds is displayed for both the current game day and the previous game day (i.e. the game day most recently ended).  The times are color coded with white indicating near standard duration (i.e. about 10, 5, 2.5 seconds for sim speed 1, 2, 3 respectively) and progressing to yellow, orange, and red as the duration increases.

If your game is running slower than the standard duration, it means your CPU cannot keep up with the requested sim speed.  There is nothing wrong with running a game at a slower duration than standard (I do it all the time), but now you are aware of it.  Changing the sim speed will cause the counters to reset.  After a game pause, the timer will continue where it left off.

The FPS display is updated every second.  The FPS is color coded with white indicating more than 30 FPS and progressing to yellow, orange, and red as the FPS decreases.  Less than 30 FPS starts to become noticeable in the smoothness of the movement of vehicles, citizens, etc.

The display starts in the upper left of the screen, but can be dragged to a new position.

[h1]Options[/h1]
The Game Day Timer can be displayed or hidden in the options.  There is also an option to reset the display to its original position in case it somehow ends up off screen.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
This mod does not alter game save files in any way and can be safely disabled or unsubscribed at any time.

This mod is compatible with all Down Loadable Content (DLC) packages thru Airports and all Content Creator Packs (CCP) thru Map Pack and Vehicles of the World.  This mod does not require any DLC or CCP to work properly.

This mod has been tested only on Windows but should work on Mac and Linux

This mod is compatible with the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1420955187]Real Time[/url] mod.  When the Real Time mod is enabled, the behavior of this mod changes as follows:[list]
[*] The timing starts immediately instead of waiting for the day to change.  Note that the timing for the first day will not include the time already passed in the first day.
[*] The times are displayed in minutes and seconds (00:00) instead of seconds and tenths (0.0).
[*] The times are NOT color coded (i.e. yellow, orange, red).
[*] Changing the sim speed between 1, 2, 3 does NOT cause the counters to reset.
[*] Changing the Time Speed (day or night) in Real Time options between 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 does NOT cause the counters to reset.[/list]

[h1]Limitations and Known Issues[/h1]
Repeatedly pausing and starting the game (e.g. by holding down the space bar or Esc key) can adversely affect the game day timing.

Game saves initiated either manually or by auto-save while the game is not paused can adversely affect the game day timing.  The real time it takes to save the game will be included in the current game day time.

Any adversely affected timing will recover on its own within two game days.
